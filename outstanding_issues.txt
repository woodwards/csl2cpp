Short list of known issues/to do for csl2cpp
csl2cpp is a series of R scripts to translate ACSLX CSL models to C++
Simon Woodward, DairyNZ 2018

Notes

- acslx.exe can't build models if C:\Program Files\Git\bin\sh.exe is in the path
- acslx.exe can't build models if C:\RTools\3.4\bin\sh.exe is in the path
- this translation project only covers the subset of ACSL functionality that we needed
- IMPLC, IMPVC implicit systems not handled
- currently uses Runge-Kutta-4 integration method
- converts int to double in min and max functions since C++ can't mix argument types
- strings are not visible to user, string functions not handled
- TERMINAL section is calculated with DYNAMIC section, not tested
- SCHEDULE must be on its own line
- INTERVAL must be on its own line
- INTEG must be on it's own line and of the form x = integ( dx, x0 )
- INTVC must be on it's own line and of the form x = integ( dx, x0 )
- DERIVT must be on it's own line and of the form dx = derivt( dx0, x )
- control variables IALG, CINT, MAXT, MINT, NSTP are treated as parameters, but not used
- comments (and statements) outside CSL sections are moved to a HEADER section
- arrays are represented using std::vector, which means list assignment resets dimensions
- arrays can be accessed using [] or .at(); the latter provides useful runtime range checking
- array access in mfiles available but not tested

To Do

- implement INTVC
- link molly.cpp into the WFM
- version control

Opportunities

- detect instabilities in the model, sudden changes in variables
- optimise step size and integration method
- remove redundant code
