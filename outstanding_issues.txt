Short list of known issues/to do for csl2cpp
csl2cpp is a series of R scripts to translate ACSLX CSL models to C++
Simon Woodward, DairyNZ 2018

Issues

- acslx.exe can't build models if C:\Program Files\Git\bin\sh.exe is in the path
- acslx.exe can't build models if C:\RTools\3.4\bin\sh.exe is in the path
- this translation project only covers the subset of ACSL functionality that we needed
- IMPLC, IMPVC implicit systems not handled
- currently assumes Runge-Kutta-4 integration method
- power operator needs to be manually translated (^ and ** are converted to *pow(1,1)*)
- C++ min and max functions can't mix int and double, need to fix manually
- strings are not visible to user, string functions not handled
- arrays are not visible to user
- handling of TERMINAL section not checked
- logic used to identify uninitialised variables may not be very robust
- SCHEDULE must be on its own line
- INTERVAL must be on its own line
- INTEG must be on it's own line
- DERIVT must be on it's own line
- control variables IALG, CINT, MAXT, MINT, NSTP are treated as parameters, but not used
- comments (and statements) outside CSL sections are moved to a HEADER section

To Do

- link molly.cpp into the WFM
- make arrays visible to user
- handle M files
- divide by zero errors
- run time testing
- version control

Opportunities

- detect instabilities in the model, sudden changes in variables
- optimise step size and integration method
- remove redundant code
