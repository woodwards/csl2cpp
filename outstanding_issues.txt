Issues

- acslx.exe can't build models if C:\Program Files\Git\bin\sh.exe is in the path
- acslx.exe can't build models if C:\RTools\3.4\bin\sh.exe is in the path
- this translation project actually only covers a small subset of ACSL functionality
- asclX code in dynamic section may not be in order
- IMPLC, IMPVC implicit systems not handled
- Assumes Runge-Kutta-4 integration method (easy to change)
- power operator needs to be manually translated (^ is converted to *pow(1,1)*)
- C++ min and max functions can't mix int and double, need to fix manually
- strings are not visible to user, string functions not handled
- arrays are not visible to user
- does not handle TERMINAL section
- SCHEDULE must be on its own line
- doesn't handle DERIVT function (which you should try to avoid anyway)

To Do

- line sorting in calc section
- Molly compilation testing
- Molly runtime testing
- separate rate calculation and post processing code
- fix event schedule since map doesn't allow duplicate keys and float keys are a problem
